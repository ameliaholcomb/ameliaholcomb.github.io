        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> I am a recent graduate from Yale University with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. In addition to my official major, I also completed all of the core courses required for the Computer Science major, as well as many of the electives. </p>
        <p> My top interests in Computer Science lie in networking and algorithm design; I am particularly interested in the latter because of its close relation to mathematics. I also have industry experience in web development, including new libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS and React/Redux. In addition to writing code, I also have great familiarity with computer hardware, working to repair laptops as a Student Technician at Yale. </p>
        <p> I am deeply committed to teaching Computer Science. While a student, I designed and taught the curriculum for training incoming Student Technicians, and I have also served as a Course Assistant and Peer Tutor for introductory and advanced computer science courses, respectively. This fall, I will be working on curriculum design, teaching, and course management with Yale's Computer Science Department. </p>

      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> I am a mathematician and computer scientist who is passionate about using her skills to fight climate change
        and biodiversity loss. </p>
      <p> Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Srinivasan
        Keshav (CS) and David Coomes (Plant Sciences). My thesis is investigating the use of remote sensing and machine
        learning to understand carbon sequestration and regrowth patterns in degraded forest regions. </p>
      <p> Prior to this, I was a software engineer in site reliability at Google. I worked on Bigtable, the Google
        database that backs Search, Maps, and other major products. I also hold an MMath degree from the University of
        Waterloo and a B.A. in Mathematics from Yale University. </p>

      <h2> News & Events </h2>

      <p> The University of Waterloo published a Global Impact story on my master's thesis work. Check out the article
        <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/global-impact/using-mobile-phone-sensors-and-drones-zero-carbon-future">
          here</a>.
      </p>
      <p> As part of <a href="https://climateaction.tech/">ClimateAction.Tech</a>, I helped to organize a TEDx
        conference on the role the tech industry can play in fighing climate change. The talk recordings are live <a
          href="https://tedx.climateaction.tech/"> here</a>. </p>

      <h2> Diversity in STEM </h2>
      <p> I co-founded Iota, a group focusing on diversity in the Yale math department. In 2016, we conducted surveys
        and interviews of both students in the math major and those who had left it, and compiled our findings and
        recommendations into a 26-page report. The report was only shared internally with the Yale College Dean's Office
        and the Math Department, but email me if you're interested in learning more.</p>

      <p> Check out articles in the Yale Daily News featuring interviews with me about diversity in CS, <a
          href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/01/29/a-programming-parity/">here</a> and <a
          href=https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/04/06/cs-town-hall-addresses-diversity>here</a>. </li>
